# CpCalendar </>

CpCalendar is a calendar for all the upcoming contests on different competitive programming platforms like Codeforces, Codechef, Leetcode, etc. The application provides you an overview of all the upcoming contests in a calendar format, which helps competitive programmers to plan their schedule for the upcoming contests in a month.

## Live
The website is live at [https://cpcalendar.netlify.app/](https://cpcalendar.netlify.app/). Please make sure to check out the website and plan your schedule for the upcoming competitive programming contests. 


## Usage
The main usage is to keep the track of all the upcoming competitive programming contests in a single place. The events are arranged in a calendar which makes it easy to track all events. I have attached some of the screenshots of the application below.

You have to include --recursion in cloning as both client and server folders are submodules of the root directory. Refer [this](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) page for more on submodules.
